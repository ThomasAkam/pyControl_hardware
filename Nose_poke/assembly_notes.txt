Electronic assembly.

- Board uses 1oz copper.

- The photo-transistor & IR led pair are soldered at a vertical offset from the board using a jig, see photos.

Mechanical assembly.

The poke body is made from 3 laser cut layers (see laser cut parts folder). 

For a mouse poke the parts needed in order from front to back are:

   Part                        Material
1. poke_front                  2mm black HIPS
2. poke_middle_small           5mm white acrylic
3. poke_back                   5mm opal 030 acrylic          
4. Printed circuit board (PCB)

For a rat poke the parts needed in order from front to back are:

   Part                        Material
1. poke_front                  1mm stainless steel
2. poke_middle_large           5mm white acrylic
3. poke_back                   5mm opal 030 acrylic          
4. Printed circuit board (PCB)

The panels and PCB are joined together using 2 x 20mm m3 bolts with 3mm spacers between the opal030 acrylic and the PCB.
