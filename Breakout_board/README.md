The Breakout board interfaces a Micropython microcontroller with a set of 6 pyControl behaviour ports, 4 BNC connectors, indicator LEDs and pushbuttons.

Each behaviour port is an 8 pin RJ45 connector which provides power (GND, 5V and 12V), two general purpose digital input/output (DIO) lines, and two driver lines which can be used for switching higher power loads such as solenoids or LEDs.  Ports 1 & 2 have an additional driver line.  Ports 3 and 4 have an additional DIO line which also supports analog output (DAC). Ports 3 and 4 support I2C or UART serial communication over two of their DIO lines.
